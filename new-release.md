To create a new freebsd release:

(assuming there's a v1.2.2 tag on the crowdsec repository)

$ git checkout v1.2.2
$ git co -b v1.2.2-freebsd-wip

 * Run "go mod vendor" in the top directory and all the notifier plugins
 * git add the vendor directories and the changes to go.mod

Commit and create a tag:

 * git commit -m "vendor dependencies for v1.2.2
 * git tag -a -m "FreeBSD release v1.2.2" v1.2.2-freebsd
 * git push origin refs/tags/v1.2.2-freebsd

There is no need to push the wip branch, it can be deleted after the release, we'll still have the tag.

In packaging-freebsd/security/crowdsec/Makefile, update PORTVERSION, PORTREVISION, GH_TAGNAME,  BUILD_VERSION and BUILD_TAG.

On a FreeBSD machine, run "make clean makesum" from the security/crowdsec directory.

Copy the distinfo file that has been generated by "make makesum" and commit it to packaging-freebsd

If the distinfo file has not changed, make sure to remove the crowdsec downloads in
"/usr/ports/distfiles/" and run makesum again - it might have used the cache
with a previous version of the same tag/branch. Should not happen if you're careful but does.

Same procedure for cs-firewall-bouncer.

TODO: build dependencies etc.
